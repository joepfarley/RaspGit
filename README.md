Portable git repository to be stored on a Raspberry Pi

I like github, I really do, but sometimes you want to keep your code local, at least within your own control. I also love git. Personally I keep git repositories for all of my text based projects. My resume, code, configuration, and any fiction I write is in a git repo. While I'm okay with my code being on github, I don't think it's appropriate for everything else to be there as well; hence the project.  

This project is designed to be a portable git repository, primarily used to store text based documents. I don't know if my goals are lofty but here they are. 

 * Web tool for establishing repositories built in (You can find code I've already started here https://github.com/joepfarley/webgit)
 * A directory of repositories for browsing
 * A quick way to implement collaboration
 * Notifications for changes to repositories
 * On site indicators for changes to repositories
